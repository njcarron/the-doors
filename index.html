The band got its name from the title of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley">Aldous Huxley's</a> book <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_of_Perception">The Doors of Perception</a></cite>, which itself was a reference to a quote made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blake">William Blake</a>, "If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is, infinite." They were unique and among <em> the most controversial and influential </em> rock acts of the 1960s, mostly because of Morrison's lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death in 1971 at age 27, the remaining members continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973.</p>
